# RAG-Based Health Data Analysis System

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for analyzing health data with a specific focus on Alzheimer's risk assessment. The system combines modern NLP techniques with medical data processing to provide educational insights into health data analysis.

## System Architecture

### Backend Components
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Supports multiple data formats (JSON, CSV, Excel, Text)
   - Standardizes input data through preprocessing pipelines
   - Implements data validation and sanitization

2. **RAG Processing Engine**
   - Utilizes SentenceTransformer for text embeddings
   - Implements semantic search capabilities
   - Maintains vector storage in MongoDB for efficient retrieval

3. **Medical Data Analysis**
   - Risk factor assessment system
   - Longitudinal data analysis
   - Pattern recognition in health metrics

4. **API Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints for data interaction
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Real-time query processing

### Frontend Components
- React-based user interface
- File upload and data visualization
- Interactive query interface
- Real-time results display

## Workflow

### 1. Data Input
```
Raw Data → Format Detection → Validation → Standardization
```
- Supports various health data formats
- Implements automatic format detection
- Validates data against predefined schemas

### 2. Processing Pipeline
```
Standardized Data → RAG Processing → Medical Analysis → Results Generation
```
- Text embedding generation
- Semantic similarity computation
- Risk factor analysis
- Temporal pattern detection

### 3. Analysis Flow
```
User Query → RAG Retrieval → Context Enhancement → Analysis → Response
```
- Contextual information retrieval
- Evidence-based analysis
- Structured response generation

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **NLP**: SentenceTransformer, NLTK
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy

### Key Features
1. **Intelligent Data Processing**
   - Automatic data format recognition
   - Smart data cleaning and normalization
   - Structured data validation

2. **Advanced Analysis**
   - RAG-based information retrieval
   - Temporal pattern analysis
   - Risk factor assessment

3. **Interactive Interface**
   - Real-time data visualization
   - Interactive query system
   - Batch processing support

## Setup and Installation

1. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**

   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Configure MongoDB connection
   - Set up environment variables
   - Adjust processing parameters

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Ensure data follows required format
   - Include necessary temporal information
   - Validate data completeness

2. **System Interaction**
